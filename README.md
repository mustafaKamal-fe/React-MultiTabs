## Multi-Tabs In Single-Page-Applications

single page applications(SPA) are single-paged!! and that is the point of them [Read this to know more.](https://medium.com/@NeotericEU/single-page-application-vs-multiple-page-application-2591588efe58) But basically, html is renderd only once and the rest is handled in the browser(like routing). Using a framework like REACT is essential to build powerfull applications in the browser and in the end you get a single-page-application where there is no paging (only one page, hence the name single-page). However, i ran into the problem of the need to use a single-page-application to build the UI and include the possibility of handling using multi-tabs within. If this is the case, clone this repo and customize it as you wish.
